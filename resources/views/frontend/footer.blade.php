            I believe in the following:
            <ul style="text-align:left;color:white">
                <li>Responsibility & accountability</li>
                <li>Listening carefully to instructions. Document them, and double-check it's fully completed.</li>
                <li>Telling the truth if I'm delayed or confused about something</li>
                <li>Being resourceful to solve anything without giving up or taking shortcuts</li>
                <li>Close enough is not good enough</li>
                <li>Any gaps in knowledge are my responsibility and cost to learn</li>
            </ul>

            Before my Coding ventures, I worked in construction design and management in Australia for around 13 years. 
            I've been trusted to design and manage millions of $'s in architecture, infrastructure, and mining, so I have a strong appreciation of responsibility and accountability.
            On the international front, I've led design teams on-site in China & Romania.
